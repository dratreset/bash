# bash
Various bash scripts

chrootSetup.sh & make_chroot_jail.sh are scripts I found online and attempted to repurpose; I found a mess of problems
with them and may need to take another look at them at a later date.

cpruby2.sh does not work as intended. The runuser command does not like me for some reason. cpruby.sh does work as intended; upon usage, you'll have to su into each user's profile and install by hand. More suscinct directions will be added to the comments within the script at a later date.
